The lower section is a smaller diameter cylinder protruding concentrically from the bottom of the larger cylinder. The bottom face of the smaller cylinder is flat, and the transition between the two sections is a sharp step. The underside of the larger cylinder has a recessed circular cavity that partially encloses the smaller cylinder, forming a ring-like groove around it. The entire component appears to be rotationally symmetric and is likely used as a shaft or connector in a mechanical assembly.'
